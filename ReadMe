# My Self-Study Journey: Cold War History & Introduction to Geopolitics

Welcome to my personal academic repository, dedicated to the subjects I've delved into on my own: Cold War History and an Introduction to Geopolitics. Here, I aim to consolidate, present, and track my progress and achievements as I navigate through these fascinating topics.

## About the Subjects

### Cold War History

The Cold War, spanning from the end of World War II in 1945 to the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, is a pivotal era in modern history. This period, characterized by political tension, proxy wars, and the nuclear arms race between the Western Bloc (led by the USA) and the Eastern Bloc (led by the USSR), has left a lasting impact on global politics, culture, and society.

### Introduction to Geopolitics

Geopolitics is the study of the effects of geography (both human and physical) on international politics and international relations. It is a field of study that examines the interactions between power, territory, and spatiality at various scales (from local to global). By understanding geopolitics, one can gain insights into the underlying spatial logic of global political events.
